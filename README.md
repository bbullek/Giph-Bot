# Giph-Bot
A small project to try out a Twitter bot with Giphy integration.
 * Host: api.giphy.com
 * Public beta key: dc6zaTOxFJmzC

# How it works:
Currently, this WIP project forms a path given a search query (e.g. "funny cat") and extracts a gif URL from the resulting JSON object provided by the Giphy API. This gif is displayed in a webpage and will eventually be integrated with an autonomous script that posts to Twitter periodically.
